# Flappy-Bird-
A python based famous game named Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game, whose goal is to let bird pass more columns by clicking the screen to fly for some height. Itâ€™s an easy game to play, because the only two actions for players are let the bird fly or do nothing (let the bird drop by itself). The evaluation is also remarkably simple, which is who can keep alive for a longer time and pass more columns win a higher score. However, this game is difficult for people to get a high score, because the rate of wrong action tolerance is exceedingly small. It is very suitable to define a model and train it to get a game AI. 


Gameplay of Flappy Bird 

Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Flappy, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Flappy through pairs of Mario-like green pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights without hitting them. Flappy automatically descends and only ascends i.e., flaps upward when the player taps the screen (here, clicks the mouse button). Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay, if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity. During the game over screen, the player is shown his/her score and is given an option to restart the game.
